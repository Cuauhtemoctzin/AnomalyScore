### Anomaly scoring for multivariate time series

This Package helps to compute anomaly scores for multivariate time series. The scores are defined based on a KNN algorithm using different approaches to determine distances between time series.

The last version of the package can be installed via:

```
devtools::install_github("Cuauhtemoctzin/AnomalyScore")
