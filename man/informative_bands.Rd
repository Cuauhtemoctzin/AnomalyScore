\title{indexes where a series is within a specific band}
\usage{
informative_bands(allbands, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{allbands}{a list with two elements the lowerbounds of all (n)(n-1)/2
pairs and the upperbounds of the pairwise bands.
Result of the function all_bands()
@param x A vector  representing a univariate time series}

A vector with indices
}
\description{
Return the indicies in which the values of a series x are located within a
band b, called the informative bands.
