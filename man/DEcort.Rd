\title{Distance based on value and behavior of the time series}
\usage{
DEcort(k, S1, S2)
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{The parameter $k$ controls the contribution of the sum of squares
comparison as a value-based metric and the $Cort$ quantity as a behavioral
metric; when $k=0$, then the distance is equal to the value-based metric,
on the other hand, when $k=6$ the distance is mainly determined by the value
of the temporal correlation $Cort$.}

\item{S1}{A vector representing a univariate time series}

\item{S2}{A second vector representing a univariate time series}
}
\value{
a non-zero value
}
\description{
Return a weighted distance based on a weighted sum of the Euclidean norm
and the temporal correlation coefficient. The distance is inflated in the
presence of NA compensating for the lack of information.
