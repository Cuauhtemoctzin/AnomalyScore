\title{Pairwise distance matrix based on the partial mutual information of mixed
embedings (PMIME) method}
\usage{
distance_matrix_PMIME(unit, Lmax, Tl, nnei, A)
}
\arguments{
\item{unit}{A matrix representing a multivariate time series where each
column is a univariate time series.
@param Lmax : the maximum delay to search for X and Y components for the mixed
embedding vector ,default is 5.
@param Tl    : Tl steps ahead that the mixed embedding vector has to explain.
Note that if Tl>1 the future vector is of length Tl and contains
the samples at times t+1,..,t+Tl ,dafault is 1.
@param nnei : number of nearest neighbors for density estimation ,default is 5
@param A    : the threshold for the ratio of CMI over MI of the lagged variables
for the termination criterion.}
