\title{Temporal correlation coefficient}
\usage{
Cort(S1, S2)
}
\arguments{
\item{S1}{A vector representing a univariate time series}

\item{S2}{A second vector representing a univariate time series}
}
\value{
A coefficient in \link{-1,1} representing the lag 1 correlation
}
\description{
Return the temporal correlations of two time series by first taking the lag
one differences of each series and the computing the correlation coefficient.
}

S1=rnorm(100)
S2=rnorm(100)
