\title{Band depth distance between 2 time series given a set of bands}
\usage{
dxy_bands(allbands, x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{allbands}{a list with two elements the lowerbounds of all (n)(n-1)/2
pairs and the upperbounds of the pairwise bands.
Result of the function \code{\link[=all_bands]{all_bands()}}}

\item{x}{A vector  representing a univariate time series}

\item{y}{A vector  representing a univariate time series}
}
\value{
A non-negative value representing the distance between two time
series, based on the concept of band depth.
}
\description{
Distance based on a depth concept, given a set of bands a modified Jaccard
measure is compute between the sets of indices that two series share,
the Jaccard distances then are averaged over all informative bands.

\examples{
X=matrix( rnorm(200), ncol=10  )
M=all_bands(X)
